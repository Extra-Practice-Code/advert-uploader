    <p id="pOne" class="info-bubble">
      E-ROB is an experimental therapy that grew out of a body of research into Online Shopping Fraud. At E-ROB we believe that being safe online is never as simple as it sounds. For whilst the warning signs of fraudulent activity can be seen and avoided, individuals still fall for scams online.
    </p>
    <p id="pTwo" class="info-bubble">
      At E-ROB we have set up a series of experiments to try to determine what underlying factors cause online buyers to misread and disregard the signs of Fraud. We want to discover whether there are desires and urges that cloud rational judgement and whether the world of e-commerce is significantly different to that of the shopping street. What makes people click?
    </p>
    <p id="pThree" class="info-bubble">
      Our therapy is situated at the heart of Dutch Design Week on Ketelhuisplein. During this period we will endeavour to investigate, analyse and question the visitors of E-ROB to expose what lies at the heart of this issue.
